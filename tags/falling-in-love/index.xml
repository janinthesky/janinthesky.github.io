      <description>I lead a straightforward and simple life.

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>
