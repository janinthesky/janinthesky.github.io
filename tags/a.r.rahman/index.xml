      <description>I found this song unintentionally. It is composed by A.R. Rahman and sung by Unnikrishnan.

      <description>A colleague of mine is taking German lessons and when the topic of poetry came up at lunch, he described Elftans, and their structure. It reminded me a little of Haiku so I said ¨Sounds like the European version of Haiku¨.</description>

      <description>This sweet love song from the movie Gentleman in the 1990s is one of A.R. Rahman&amp;#8217;s lesser known gems. It has a fresh, innocent, morning feel to it even though the lyrics are more explicit than many other Tamil songs of that time.</description>

      <description>This song has two versions. One sung by a little girl and the other by an adult male voice(Hariharan). It is melodious and beautiful. They have some variations in lyrics so I have chosen to translate the one by the child.</description>

      <description>From the movie Bombay, this is another super-hit from Rahman. Hariharan&amp;#8217;s voice makes it take on a etheral quality. And if I may say so, these lyrics far out-beat the Hindi remake.</description>
