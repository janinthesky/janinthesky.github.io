Strong, independent and capable
Living every day well;
I find happiness in</description>

      <description>Written in 2007
Pablo Neruda starts by dismissing traditional or conventional ways of loving:
&amp;#8216;as if you were a rose of salt topaz.&amp;#8217; The &amp;#8216;rose of salt&amp;#8217; could mean a pure white rose symbolising the supposed purest, truest form of love.</description>

      <description>The wind screeches through the vents as the hail throws itself unrelentingly on my windows and unforgivingly on the skylights above. This big house is empty and the forceful cold roar of the storm echoes apocalyptically through the corridors.</description>

An enzyme
Ready
Arrive
The electrons
Stretch to welcome
You float above the substrate
Before you form a link

      <description>The lyrics of this song uses vivid imagery of colours to describe love and the woman he is in love with. The song begins with him shouting out in joy that she smiled at him.</description>

      <description>Where are you? I’m here, waiting. Full moon waned to half. You watch me wait, Cruelly test my endurance. The sun rises and sets. I could watch it all alone And know you&amp;#8217;re there Watching with me in spirit From the hilltop.</description>
