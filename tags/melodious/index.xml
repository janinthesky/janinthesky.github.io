      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>Back to more recent times. I remember this and another song&amp;#8217;s effects and graphics very well from when I watched the movie Kadhalan. Patta Rap, Mukkala Mukkabala and other songs from this movie also became very popular but this must be the most melodious of the collection.</description>
