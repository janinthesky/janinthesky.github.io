      <description>Here is a song with both Rajani and Kamal Hassan with Jayaprada. It is from a movie called Ninaithale Inikkum. Also from the 80´s. Thanks to my dad for corrections with the translation.</description>

      <description>Talk about twisted! Rajani is a true villian in this song. You must watch the video to understand why, though the audio alone should also suffice.</description>

      <description>Theme Betrayal! The beat is peppy, but the song conveys his pain. It is almost caustically sarcastic in some parts. Kamal&amp;#8217;s character is singing to the girl who left him for his friend.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>
