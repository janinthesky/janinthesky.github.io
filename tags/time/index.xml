      <description>I love writing. Whether it is pen on paper or finger-tips on keys, the feeling I get when I express myself is uniquely gratifying.

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often ‘love’ is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>
