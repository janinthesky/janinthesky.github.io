      <description>Om is a syllable, not a word. And though it has a lot of mythical and symbolic importance in the Hindu tradition, it has no single meaning to be pinned down to.</description>

      <description>20th December 2013

      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</link>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

Views on other beliefs
I retain a relatively moderate view on people who take an external god literally, so long as they never cross the line of violence especially with children, nature or other cultures.</description>

Nethi= clean (Sanskrit)
