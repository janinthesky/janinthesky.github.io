      <description>October 2008
This yellow evening,
Winds tell of rains to come.
A healthy, happy wind
That I haven’t felt for so long.
Dry mango leaves</description>

      <description>This is a relatively old song. The lyrics are in rustic Tamil style. Melody by Ilayaraja.

      <description>Theme Betrayal! The beat is peppy, but the song conveys his pain. It is almost caustically sarcastic in some parts. Kamal’s character is singing to the girl who left him for his friend.</description>

      <description>Here is another Ilayaraja song. A melody from Solla Thudikuthu Manasu.
**poovae sempoovae un vaasam varum
vaasal en vaasal un poongaavanam

      <description>This is a slightly philosophical song. His sister is the breadwinner of the family and he is a ‘good for nothing’ alcoholic, she treats him with contempt.</description>

      <description>This song is from the movie Keladi Kanmani. A widower is bringing up a child and when he meets one of her teachers, they begin to fall in love.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>The lyrics of this song uses vivid imagery of colours to describe love and the woman he is in love with. The song begins with him shouting out in joy that she smiled at him.</description>

      <description>A beautiful song from Thalapathi.
**Yamunai atrile ira katrile
Kannanodu than aada
Parvai poothida padhai parthida
Pavai radhaiyo vada**

      <description>From the movie Bombay, this is another super-hit from Rahman. Hariharan’s voice makes it take on a etheral quality. And if I may say so, these lyrics far out-beat the Hindi remake.</description>

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>I’ve always found this song very hauntingly romantic.

      <description>When I was a child in Australia, someone choreographed an amazing dance for this song. I still remember a lot of it. Go MGR! 🙂</description>

      <description>I think by now it is quite easy to tell I am a big fan of Kamal Hassan. His acting is so versatile, it truly is a pity that just because of the language and/or a cultural barrier, the rest of the world is missing out.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji – The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a ‘*’), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>In this song, Kamal’s character is singing to Sridevi’s character. The story of Moondraam Pirai is about a troubled young man who finds a mentally ill girl about to be sold for the first time in a brothal.</description>

      <description>I recommend this beautiful movie to everyone. In this song, the uber-talented dancer has become an alcoholic and he sings and dances referring to the past he shares with the widow who is watching him.</description>
