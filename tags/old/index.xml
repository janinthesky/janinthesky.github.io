Hello!
Itâ€™s nearly noon on this bright sunshiny Sunday. The temperature is 8 Degrees Celsius. Last night it hit an unusual 9 degrees! I had planned to pull out my gloves only after December started but I remember November days being colder than this!</description>

      <description>This is a slightly philosophical song. His sister is the breadwinner of the family and he is a â€˜good for nothingâ€™ alcoholic, she treats him with contempt.</description>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie â€˜Fiddler on the Roofâ€™.</description>

      <description>When I was a child in Australia, someone choreographed an amazing dance for this song. I still remember a lot of it. Go MGR! ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>Another classic oldie of more philosophical nature. We donâ€™t get these anymore. Thanks to my dad for correcting the meanings.
