      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve always found this song very hauntingly romantic.

      <description>When I was a child in Australia, someone choreographed an amazing dance for this song. I still remember a lot of it. Go MGR! ðŸ™‚</description>

      <description>The dance is ridiculous in this video but the song is good. Thanks to my dad for correcting the meanings. They make a lot more sense now ðŸ™‚ .</description>

      <description>I think by now it is quite easy to tell I am a big fan of Kamal Hassan. His acting is so versatile, it truly is a pity that just because of the language and/or a cultural barrier, the rest of the world is missing out.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji â€“ The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a â€˜*â€™), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>In this song, Kamalâ€™s character is singing to Srideviâ€™s character. The story of Moondraam Pirai is about a troubled young man who finds a mentally ill girl about to be sold for the first time in a brothal.</description>

      <description>I recommend this beautiful movie to everyone. In this song, the uber-talented dancer has become an alcoholic and he sings and dances referring to the past he shares with the widow who is watching him.</description>
