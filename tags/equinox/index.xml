Hi!
Yes, it&amp;#8217;s been a long time. Nearly 5 months since I last wrote an update email.

After some rain last night, the air smells like monsoon in India; so fresh and clean! IÂ´ve opened the window to let it come in and along with it are the chirps and tweets of the birds.</description>

Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.

It corresponds with what Joseph Campbell says about the spiritual world (as represented by myths and anecdotes from those who meditate, and shamans), drugs and psychological diseases like schizophrenia.</description>

Hi Everyone ðŸ™‚
We are halfway through March and temperatures are now ranging between 7-13! Quite warm (relatively) and it is now ok to venture out with either a light jacket with a heavy-ish sweater or with only one heavy jacket on.</description>

Hello everyone,
We passed the Equinox on the 21st of March. We celebrated and welcomed spring in full swing. Daffodils now grow where the White and purple flowers did.</description>
