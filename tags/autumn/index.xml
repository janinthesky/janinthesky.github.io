      <description>22nd September 2011
This morning on the radio, I heard a weather report unlike any other. The lady was shouting in German with even some ‘bad words’ which I could recognise about the summer which had more than its share of rain and how horrible it was that the bad weather was continuing into Autumn.</description>

      <description>It is time for leaves to bid farewell to the trees they leave
Where they have lived for two happy seasons
Leaving is an elation</description>

      <description>On this misty night
Trees are backlit mystically
She cannot welcome
Winter with any warmth
Yet, when you are near
The biting wind is forgiven</description>

      <description>However dim the light,
The leaves glow bright
In the Autumn Garden
Almost as if they had a light of their own
Golden yellow, orange</description>
