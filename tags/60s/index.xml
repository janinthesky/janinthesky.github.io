Hello,
Tonight I sleep in Bremen Airport to be on time for a very early morning flight to Barcelona where I will meet two of my close friends from my year in Edinburgh … it will be one of their birthdays during the weekend when we will be there and we will be staying with the kind hospitality of the other’s brother.</description>
