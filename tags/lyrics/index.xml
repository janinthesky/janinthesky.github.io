      <description>This is a translation of a recent song from a movie called Saivam that my mum recommended I listen to. I listened to it last night and fell in love with the voice.</description>

      <description>Here is another Kamal song sung by SPB. This is from the movie Aboorva Sagotharargal where Kamal acts as brothers. One who looks normal and another who is very short.</description>

      <description>Here is a song from the movie Vandicholai Chinraasu. For the light comical tune it keeps, the last verse is incongruously preachy. It reflects the morals and values of the early 90s especially in smaller towns.</description>

      <description>This is a slightly philosophical song. His sister is the breadwinner of the family and he is a &amp;#8216;good for nothing&amp;#8217; alcoholic, she treats him with contempt.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>The lyrics of this song uses vivid imagery of colours to describe love and the woman he is in love with. The song begins with him shouting out in joy that she smiled at him.</description>

      <description>A beautiful song from Thalapathi.

      <description>From the movie Bombay, this is another super-hit from Rahman. Hariharan&amp;#8217;s voice makes it take on a etheral quality. And if I may say so, these lyrics far out-beat the Hindi remake.</description>

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>I think by now it is quite easy to tell I am a big fan of Kamal Hassan. His acting is so versatile, it truly is a pity that just because of the language and/or a cultural barrier, the rest of the world is missing out.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji – The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a ‘*’), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often &amp;#8216;love&amp;#8217; is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>
