      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>

      <description>Back to more recent times. I remember this and another songâ€™s effects and graphics very well from when I watched the movie Kadhalan. Patta Rap, Mukkala Mukkabala and other songs from this movie also became very popular but this must be the most melodious of the collection.</description>

      <description>When people fall in love in many Indian movies, the various stages of love are expressed in the form of songs. This nurtures the music industry and aids the current rules of censorship that prohibit on screen kissing on lips and other forms of displays of affection.</description>
