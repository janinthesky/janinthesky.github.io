      <description>I lead a straightforward and simple life. I work, have light conversations with my colleagues during lunch, come back to my flat, cook, hang out with my flatmates or other friends, read, sing, Skype with family and friends in other countries, and watch series like Star Trek and Grey&amp;#8217;s Anatomy.</description>

      <description>What a magnificent construction
This tall metal brick tower
This world of common definitions
Where I am the epitome of purity,
Goodness, sincerity and compassion.</description>
