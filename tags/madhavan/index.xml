      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>The movie this song is from is also called Anbe Sivam. It is one of Kamal Hassan´s most poignant movies and I recommend it to everyone if they can find it with subtitles.</description>
