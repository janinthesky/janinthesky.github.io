      <description>This song is a classic. It is from a movie called Paasa Malar (flower or affection). I grew up listening to lots of oldies and enjoyed their high lyricism.</description>

      <description>The movie this song is from is also called Anbe Sivam. It is one of Kamal Hassan´s most poignant movies and I recommend it to everyone if they can find it with subtitles.</description>
