      <description>Theme Betrayal! The beat is peppy, but the song conveys his pain. It is almost caustically sarcastic in some parts. Kamal’s character is singing to the girl who left him for his friend.</description>

      <description>When people fall in love in many Indian movies, the various stages of love are expressed in the form of songs. This nurtures the music industry and aids the current rules of censorship that prohibit on screen kissing on lips and other forms of displays of affection.</description>
