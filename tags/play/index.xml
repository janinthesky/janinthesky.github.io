      <description>From May 2008
For too long I have absorbed.
Here in this moonlight. I still see colour.
I breathe. I create.
There is no romantic breeze</description>

      <description>On Gandhi’s birthday I think of two people. One is my cousin who shares his birthday and the other is my maternal grandma who taught me most of what I know about Gandhian values.</description>
