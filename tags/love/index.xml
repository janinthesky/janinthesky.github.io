      <description>I tend to avoid the news when I can. It upsets me and since I can&amp;#8217;t do much about most of those issues far away I satisfy myself by trying to live in the best way I can; compassionately, sincerely and respectfully.</description>

      <description>I lead a straightforward and simple life. I work, have light conversations with my colleagues during lunch, come back to my flat, cook, hang out with my flatmates or other friends, read, sing, Skype with family and friends in other countries, and watch series like Star Trek and Grey&amp;#8217;s Anatomy.</description>

      <description>Dear Women of India,
I hope you will soon learn to laugh at the ads which endorse the notion that having lighter brown skin makes you more beautiful than you are already.</description>

      <description>25th May 2007
I suddenly realize I am a machine. I do the same things everyday. I’ve stopped feeling. I’ve stopped thinking.
I’m too busy with my life.</description>

      <description>From May 2008
For too long I have absorbed.
Here in this moonlight. I still see colour.
I breathe. I create.
There is no romantic breeze</description>

Violence and aggression rise from fear and greed. What gives the Chinese the right to violate human rights? To kill and torture people?</description>

      <description>From April 2008:
Words like love and god are of the most ambiguous. What do people mean when they ask ‘do you believe in god’ or say ‘I love you’.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>A lot of futuristic science fiction puts forward several ideas of what an android would be like. Data from Star Trek (TNG) is an intriguing character who tries very hard to understand what it is to be human.</description>

      <title>Arranged Marriage</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2011-08-06-arranged-marriage/</link>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie &amp;#8216;Fiddler on the Roof&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always found this song very hauntingly romantic.

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often &amp;#8216;love&amp;#8217; is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>

      <description>Oh, Symbol of material Love,
The ‘Apple’ of my eye,
Your cold, mountain fragrance,
Red beauty, Temptation,
You are the reason for life, Knowledge, for the world’s Material existence and Humanity’s distance from god.</description>
