Hello everyone,
It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since I last wrote, partly because I&amp;#8217;ve not been doing too much of new things &amp;#8211; the project develops, and software glitches occur daily that I patiently overcome.</description>

      <title>Arranged Marriage</title>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie &amp;#8216;Fiddler on the Roof&amp;#8217;.</description>
