      <description>This sad song is also from the movie Thalapathy. Just like Sundari Kannal oru Sethi and Yamunai Atrile. (Thanks to my dad for corrections.)
In this movie, RajaniÂ´s character was abandoned on a train by his mum as a baby.</description>

      <description>This song is a classic. It is from a movie called Paasa Malar (flower or affection). I grew up listening to lots of oldies and enjoyed their high lyricism.</description>
