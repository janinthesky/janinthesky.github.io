      <description>This is a beautiful song which is for mothers from their grateful children. In the movie the character portrayed by Rajani Kanth is taking care of his old mother.</description>

      <description>This sad song is also from the movie Thalapathy. Just like Sundari Kannal oru Sethi and Yamunai Atrile. (Thanks to my dad for corrections.)
In this movie, Rajani´s character was abandoned on a train by his mum as a baby.</description>

      <description>When people fall in love in many Indian movies, the various stages of love are expressed in the form of songs. This nurtures the music industry and aids the current rules of censorship that prohibit on screen kissing on lips and other forms of displays of affection.</description>
