      <description>I tend to avoid the news when I can. It upsets me and since I can&amp;#8217;t do much about most of those issues far away I satisfy myself by trying to live in the best way I can; compassionately, sincerely and respectfully.</description>

Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.
