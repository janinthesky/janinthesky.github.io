Views on other beliefs
I retain a relatively moderate view on people who take an external god literally, so long as they never cross the line of violence especially with children, nature or other cultures.</description>

      <description>Talk about twisted! Rajani is a true villian in this song. You must watch the video to understand why, though the audio alone should also suffice.</description>

      <description>Theme Betrayal! The beat is peppy, but the song conveys his pain. It is almost caustically sarcastic in some parts. Kamal&amp;#8217;s character is singing to the girl who left him for his friend.</description>

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>In this song, Kamal’s character is singing to Sridevi’s character. The story of Moondraam Pirai is about a troubled young man who finds a mentally ill girl about to be sold for the first time in a brothal.</description>

      <description>I recommend this beautiful movie to everyone. In this song, the uber-talented dancer has become an alcoholic and he sings and dances referring to the past he shares with the widow who is watching him.</description>

      <description>The movie this song is from is also called Anbe Sivam. It is one of Kamal Hassan´s most poignant movies and I recommend it to everyone if they can find it with subtitles.</description>
