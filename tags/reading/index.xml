Hello!!
It’s been a while it seems since my last update.

Hello everyone!
The weather this week albeit two days in the middle has been pleasant with sunny blue skies. This is most unexpected in Edinburgh but a joy to us although the wind can be a real bully while walking; pushing us forward and backward with no warning!</description>
