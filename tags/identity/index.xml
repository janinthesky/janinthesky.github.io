Hi!
Yes, it&amp;#8217;s been a long time. Nearly 5 months since I last wrote an update email.
In November I went to Berlin for my UK visa, and spent whatever hours I was not at work or sleeping on writing a novel.</description>

      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</link>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

Identities Preferences and Behaviour
Where does the self come from? Identity and our definitions of our ‘self’ are a result of what we’ve been taught from the beginning of our lives.</description>

      <description>From December 2007
I think that wasting time is criminal. Somehow, there has to be a purpose to everything. And when there is none, I feel like I don’t deserve to exist.</description>

      <description>It is too difficult for a European to see India as one country when they understand it&amp;#8217;s diversity is more at the scale of a continent &amp;#8211; their continent.</description>

      <title>Arranged Marriage</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2011-08-06-arranged-marriage/</link>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie &amp;#8216;Fiddler on the Roof&amp;#8217;.</description>
