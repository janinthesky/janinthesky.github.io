      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji â€“ The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a â€˜*â€™), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>
