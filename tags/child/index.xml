      <description>I lead a straightforward and simple life. I work, have light conversations with my colleagues during lunch, come back to my flat, cook, hang out with my flatmates or other friends, read, sing, Skype with family and friends in other countries, and watch series like Star Trek and Grey&amp;#8217;s Anatomy.</description>

In some ways, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter whether people are reading my post or not, because the sheer pleasure of writing is really enough of a motivation.</description>

I’m too busy with my life.</description>

      <description>On Gandhi&amp;#8217;s birthday I think of two people. One is my cousin who shares his birthday and the other is my maternal grandma who taught me most of what I know about Gandhian values.</description>

      <description>This song has two versions. One sung by a little girl and the other by an adult male voice(Hariharan). It is melodious and beautiful. They have some variations in lyrics so I have chosen to translate the one by the child.</description>
