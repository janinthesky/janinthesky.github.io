      <description>5th May, 2011
Hello,
Tonight I sleep in Bremen Airport to be on time for a very early morning flight to Barcelona where I will meet two of my close friends from my year in Edinburgh &amp;#8230; it will be one of their birthdays during the weekend when we will be there and we will be staying with the kind hospitality of the other&amp;#8217;s brother.</description>

      <description>On Gandhi&amp;#8217;s birthday I think of two people. One is my cousin who shares his birthday and the other is my maternal grandma who taught me most of what I know about Gandhian values.</description>
