      <description>Theme Betrayal! The beat is peppy, but the song conveys his pain. It is almost caustically sarcastic in some parts. Kamal’s character is singing to the girl who left him for his friend.</description>

      <description>From Thenali, another Kamal Movie (:)), this clip starts with her singing to him and he tells her that it would be better to sing a duet in their dreams (unobserved by street people) so they can change location and clothes as they please (as it typical of movie songs).</description>
