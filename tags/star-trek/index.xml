Hello everyone ðŸ™‚
I just returned from a trip to GÃ¶ttingen where my flatmates and I celebrated an old flatmateâ€™s birthday. We took a train yesterday morning and I was quite taken in by the beauty of the countryside.</description>

Hi Everyone ðŸ™‚
We are halfway through March and temperatures are now ranging between 7-13! Quite warm (relatively) and it is now ok to venture out with either a light jacket with a heavy-ish sweater or with only one heavy jacket on.</description>

Hello everyone,
I just came back from an hour of the most exhausting exercise in probably Years! I never realised how out-of-shape I have been until I saw 60 odd other people able to jump around during what they call â€˜Power Gymâ€™ for an hour while I was out of breath within 15 minutes.</description>

      <description>A lot of futuristic science fiction puts forward several ideas of what an android would be like. Data from Star Trek (TNG) is an intriguing character who tries very hard to understand what it is to be human.</description>
