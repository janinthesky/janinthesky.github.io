      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

      <description>Water used to be free. In some parts of the world it still is but with all the pollution and diseases, it is becoming increasingly difficult to safely drink straight from a river, and in many parts of the world, from the tap.</description>

      <description>The author seems to be trying to achieve the effect of time all being one moment. The effect of this hits the reader in full force in the end when it goes back to Garuda, who was last mentioned in the first chapter reading the Rg Veda, waking up from a light doze on the word ‘Ka’.</description>

      <description>This sweet love song from the movie Gentleman in the 1990s is one of A.R. Rahman’s lesser known gems. It has a fresh, innocent, morning feel to it even though the lyrics are more explicit than many other Tamil songs of that time.</description>

My cough is completely gone. It took its own time and I waited patiently 🙂
Last night was Halloween. We were out all night partying.</description>

Greetings!
I recover from a cough as I write this. The reason for the long silence is the fever I had last weekend. I know you kind-hearted people are starting to worry already!</description>

All is well on this side of the world. I am cocooned in academic life and don’t hear the news very often.</description>

Hello everyone!
The weather this week albeit two days in the middle has been pleasant with sunny blue skies. This is most unexpected in Edinburgh but a joy to us although the wind can be a real bully while walking; pushing us forward and backward with no warning!</description>

In this movie, Rajani´s character was abandoned on a train by his mum as a baby.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie ‘Fiddler on the Roof’.</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>I think by now it is quite easy to tell I am a big fan of Kamal Hassan. His acting is so versatile, it truly is a pity that just because of the language and/or a cultural barrier, the rest of the world is missing out.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji – The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a ‘*’), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often ‘love’ is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>

      <description>When people fall in love in many Indian movies, the various stages of love are expressed in the form of songs. This nurtures the music industry and aids the current rules of censorship that prohibit on screen kissing on lips and other forms of displays of affection.</description>
