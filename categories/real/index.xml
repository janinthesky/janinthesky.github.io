Greetings!
I recover from a cough as I write this. The reason for the long silence is the fever I had last weekend. I know you kind-hearted people are starting to worry already!</description>

Hello everyone!
The weather this week albeit two days in the middle has been pleasant with sunny blue skies. This is most unexpected in Edinburgh but a joy to us although the wind can be a real bully while walking; pushing us forward and backward with no warning!</description>

      <description>Different approaches are necessary for different types of books; Novels and most popular science books are meant to be read cover to cover. Dictionaries, encyclopedias and other factual texts are meant to be looked up for specific information.</description>

      <description>Arranged marriage is an old concept. It existed long before people accepted love (that occurred before marriage) as a valid reason to marry. The process through which this changed is reflected very well in the movie &amp;#8216;Fiddler on the Roof&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji – The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a ‘*’), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often &amp;#8216;love&amp;#8217; is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>

      <description>It is a strange relationship humans share with music. Music isn&amp;#8217;t to convey any rational point. It is a form of expression which is artistic and more emotional in nature.</description>
