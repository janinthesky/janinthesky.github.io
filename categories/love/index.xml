      <description>I was raised vegetarian and my family has been vegetarian for generations. When I was thirteen or fourteen, my parents told me that since I will be travelling when I get older, I could start getting used to meat if I wanted to.</description>

      <description>I tend to avoid the news when I can. It upsets me and since I can&amp;#8217;t do much about most of those issues far away I satisfy myself by trying to live in the best way I can; compassionately, sincerely and respectfully.</description>

After some rain last night, the air smells like monsoon in India; so fresh and clean! IÂ´ve opened the window to let it come in and along with it are the chirps and tweets of the birds.</description>

      <description>I lead a straightforward and simple life. I work, have light conversations with my colleagues during lunch, come back to my flat, cook, hang out with my flatmates or other friends, read, sing, Skype with family and friends in other countries, and watch series like Star Trek and Grey&amp;#8217;s Anatomy.</description>

      <description>Written in 2007
Pablo Neruda starts by dismissing traditional or conventional ways of loving:
&amp;#8216;as if you were a rose of salt topaz.&amp;#8217; The &amp;#8216;rose of salt&amp;#8217; could mean a pure white rose symbolising the supposed purest, truest form of love.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>It is perhaps important to differentiate the various meaning that we refer to when we say the word love. Often &amp;#8216;love&amp;#8217; is used in the place of a more suitable word.</description>
