After some rain last night, the air smells like monsoon in India; so fresh and clean! IÂ´ve opened the window to let it come in and along with it are the chirps and tweets of the birds.</description>

Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.

Hi Everyone ðŸ™‚
We are halfway through March and temperatures are now ranging between 7-13! Quite warm (relatively) and it is now ok to venture out with either a light jacket with a heavy-ish sweater or with only one heavy jacket on.</description>

Hello everyone,
I just came back from an hour of the most exhausting exercise in probably Years! I never realised how out-of-shape I have been until I saw 60 odd other people able to jump around during what they call &amp;#8216;Power Gym&amp;#8217; for an hour while I was out of breath within 15 minutes.</description>
