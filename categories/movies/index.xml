Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.

Identities Preferences and Behaviour
Where does the self come from? Identity and our definitions of our â€˜selfâ€™ are a result of what weâ€™ve been taught from the beginning of our lives.</description>

      <description>Talk about twisted! Rajani is a true villian in this song. You must watch the video to understand why, though the audio alone should also suffice.</description>

      <description>From the movie Bombay, this is another super-hit from Rahman. Hariharan&amp;#8217;s voice makes it take on a etheral quality. And if I may say so, these lyrics far out-beat the Hindi remake.</description>

      <description>A.R. Rahman had another party with this movie. He has explored several new styles including hip pop in the movie Shivaji â€“ The Boss. Although it has some lines just for the sake of rhyming lyrics(I will mark these with a â€˜*â€™), this song makes me long for home.</description>

      <description>This raagam, called Mahati, has only 4 notes. In Karnatic music, all raagams have either 5, 6 or 7 notes. But Balamurali Krishna invented this one and was critisised for his non-traditional innovation.</description>

      <description>The movie this song is from is also called Anbe Sivam. It is one of Kamal HassanÂ´s most poignant movies and I recommend it to everyone if they can find it with subtitles.</description>

      <description>Beautiful spirited women and a wreck of a man. All the possible ways to screw up one&amp;#8217;s marriage and work, he does it. He hurts people all along the way.</description>
