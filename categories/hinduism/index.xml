      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2013-04-10-introduction-to-the-indian-caste-system/</guid>
      <description>Let me introduce you to the caste system in India. There are four main castes usually listed in the following order;
The Castes
Brahmins, the teachers, and priests who occupied themselves with the task of performing common ceremonies such as weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals and house-warming as well as yagnas and other religious activities.</description>

      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</link>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.
http://www.esoterictube.com/dmt-the-spirit-molecule.html
It corresponds with what Joseph Campbell says about the spiritual world (as represented by myths and anecdotes from those who meditate, and shamans), drugs and psychological diseases like schizophrenia.</description>
