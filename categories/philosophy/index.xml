      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</link>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

Hello everyone,
I watched this video recently.
http://www.esoterictube.com/dmt-the-spirit-molecule.htmlIt corresponds with what Joseph Campbell says about the spiritual world (as represented by myths and anecdotes from those who meditate, and shamans), drugs and psychological diseases like schizophrenia.</description>

Hello everyone,
I just came back from an hour of the most exhausting exercise in probably Years! I never realised how out-of-shape I have been until I saw 60 odd other people able to jump around during what they call ‘Power Gym’ for an hour while I was out of breath within 15 minutes.</description>

      <description>From August 2008
We assume Immortality. Only a death of someone close to us reminds us of our Impermanence.
We make promises and think of ways to make our lives more meaningful, now that we’ve experienced this reminder.</description>

I retain a relatively moderate view on people who take an external god literally, so long as they never cross the line of violence especially with children, nature or other cultures.</description>
