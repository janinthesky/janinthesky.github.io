      <title>Spiritual, religious or philosophical?</title>
      <link>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</link>

      <guid>https://janinthesky.com/blog/2012-10-15-spiritual-religious-or-philosophical/</guid>
      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>
