      <description>This sweet love song from the movie Gentleman in the 1990s is one of A.R. Rahman&amp;#8217;s lesser known gems. It has a fresh, innocent, morning feel to it even though the lyrics are more explicit than many other Tamil songs of that time.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>Back to more recent times. I remember this and another song&amp;#8217;s effects and graphics very well from when I watched the movie Kadhalan. Patta Rap, Mukkala Mukkabala and other songs from this movie also became very popular but this must be the most melodious of the collection.</description>

      <description>If anyone were to remake this song with rock instruments, I think it would hit the rock charts world wide even if no one understood it.</description>

      <description>This song is a classic. It is from a movie called Paasa Malar (flower or affection). I grew up listening to lots of oldies and enjoyed their high lyricism.</description>

      <description>The movie this song is from is also called Anbe Sivam. It is one of Kamal HassanÂ´s most poignant movies and I recommend it to everyone if they can find it with subtitles.</description>

      <description>Bangs and Bags go together. Women have fancied them so since the beginning of fashion history. They go together like carrots and peas, sweet and sour, beauty and the beast.</description>
