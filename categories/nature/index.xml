      <description>Many people confuse spirituality with religiousness, and philosophy with spirituality. Here I will attempt to tease out the differences as I see them.
To be religious is to follow a given set of rules generally defined by an existing system of organised faith.</description>

We assume Immortality. Only a death of someone close to us reminds us of our Impermanence.
We make promises and think of ways to make our lives more meaningful, now that weâ€™ve experienced this reminder.</description>

Trees are backlit mystically
She cannot welcome
Winter with any warmth
Yet, when you are near
The biting wind is forgiven</description>

No where to hide
To be alone or cry.
No one to understand the loverâ€™s yearning for the mountains</description>

Falling leaves; dry and

Newborns sprouting

      <description>A lot of futuristic science fiction puts forward several ideas of what an android would be like. Data from Star Trek (TNG) is an intriguing character who tries very hard to understand what it is to be human.</description>

      <description>Oh, Symbol of material Love,
The â€˜Appleâ€™ of my eye,
Your cold, mountain fragrance,
Red beauty, Temptation,
By you, we were separated from Eden.
Peaceful, wholesome, godly Eden.</description>
