I look for my reflection
I love my reflection.
It isn’t me but my only companion
Through life.
And sometimes it is me.</description>

      <description>This is a melodious potential Ohrwurm which describes how he is falling in love. As it seems to be typical of the time period in which this movie was made, the choreography is weird, their expressions seem more contemplative or sad than joyful and the costume design is odd but the song sounds good.</description>

      <description>This song was a big hit when it first came out and still is very popular. It is from the movie Minnile which means lightning. It is considered a sensual song and therefore it must have some strange dance scenes in the middle to leave the real sensual things to imagination if you be so inclined.</description>

      <description>I recommend this beautiful movie to everyone. In this song, the uber-talented dancer has become an alcoholic and he sings and dances referring to the past he shares with the widow who is watching him.</description>

      <description>Back to more recent times. I remember this and another song’s effects and graphics very well from when I watched the movie Kadhalan. Patta Rap, Mukkala Mukkabala and other songs from this movie also became very popular but this must be the most melodious of the collection.</description>

      <description>When people fall in love in many Indian movies, the various stages of love are expressed in the form of songs. This nurtures the music industry and aids the current rules of censorship that prohibit on screen kissing on lips and other forms of displays of affection.</description>
